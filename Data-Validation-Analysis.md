# Data Validation & Cleanup Analysis

## **Enhancement Overview**
**Task**: Data Validation & Cleanup  
**Impact**: Improved data quality and query reliability  
**Implementation**: Data cleaning scripts  
**Effort**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: None  

## **Current Data Quality Issues to Address**

### **1. Player Name Standardization**
- Inconsistent name formats (e.g., "Roger Federer" vs "R. Federer" vs "Federer, Roger")
- Nickname variations (e.g., "Andy Murray" vs "A. Murray")
- Different transliterations for international players

### **2. Date Validation**
- Ensure all dates are within reasonable ranges (1877-2024)
- Check for future dates or impossible dates
- Validate date consistency across related records

### **3. Score Format Consistency**
- Standardize score formats (e.g., "6-4" vs "6-4" vs "6-4")
- Handle tiebreaks consistently (e.g., "7-6(4)" vs "7-6 4")
- Validate score logic (e.g., sets should be 6+ games, tiebreaks at 6-6)

### **4. Tournament Name Standardization**
- Standardize tournament names (e.g., "Wimbledon" vs "The Championships, Wimbledon")
- Handle venue changes over time
- Standardize surface classifications

### **5. Player ID Consistency**
- Ensure player IDs are consistent across matches
- Handle duplicate player entries
- Validate player metadata consistency

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Create validation functions** for each data type
2. **Add data quality scoring** to measure improvement
3. **Implement standardization rules** for names and tournaments
4. **Add data consistency checks** across related tables
5. **Create cleanup reports** showing what was fixed

## **Expected Impact**
- **Improved query accuracy** - standardized names make searches more reliable
- **Better data analysis** - consistent formats enable better aggregations
- **Enhanced user experience** - cleaner data leads to better AI responses
- **Reduced edge cases** - fewer data inconsistencies to handle

## **Next Steps**
- Implement comprehensive data validation and cleanup functions
- This would be a great foundation for ensuring the database maintains high quality as we add more data sources
